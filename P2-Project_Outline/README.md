## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My app will make it easy for users to stay up to date and engaged with legislation in their state. Legislation will be shown based on status (introduced, passed house, passed senate) and users will be provided names of their representatives and links to directly email them through the users preferred email app. The idea came from my increased interest in actively engaging in our democracy. I have learned that my voice does matter and that if I want to make a difference in the world then I need to use it. My main resource for information regarding legislation moving in the system is Instagram. Social media is not a place that provides adequate context or results; however, social media tends to be where people go for information because government websites can be tricky and not at all user friendly. Having one place to find information without outside opinion is a wanted necessity for people that want factual information and to engage in our democracy by using their voice.
